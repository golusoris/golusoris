# Vendored interfig

`upstream/` holds a byte-identical subset of interfig, the figure engine behind
the animated architecture figures on the Hindsight documentation site. Praetor
uses it to draw its documentation figures
([figures guide](../../../../docs/guides/figures.md)). The decision record is
[ADR-0015](../../../../docs/adr/0015-interactive-figures-from-vendored-interfig.md).

## Source and pin

- Repository: <https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight>
- Path: `hindsight-interfig/`
- Pinned commit: `ccfe85b4851957ac2adf88b4a9ddf9668b2882f1`
- Last upstream change under the path:
  `db03d5448ff1290cc6e501aa7f62d5e4a1e979a3`
- Fetched: 2026-09-27

`vendor.json` records the same pin, the include and exclude lists, and the
SHA-256 of every file under `upstream/`.

## License and credit

<!-- REUSE-IgnoreStart -->
interfig is MIT-licensed, Copyright (c) 2025 Vectorize AI, Inc.
<!-- REUSE-IgnoreEnd -->
`upstream/` has no license
file of its own in the upstream tree, so `upstream/LICENSE` is the
repository-root `LICENSE` at the pinned commit, copied verbatim.

- `REUSE.toml` labels `tools/figures/third_party/interfig/upstream/**` as MIT
  with an override annotation placed after the repository-wide `**` table. This
  file, `vendor.json` and everything outside `upstream/` stay EUPL-1.2.
- The committed player in `tools/figures/dist/` carries an
  `interfig (c) 2025 Vectorize AI, Inc. MIT` banner, because the upstream
  source has no header of its own, and `dist/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` carries
  the full license text (`tools/figures/bundle.mjs`).
- Every exported SVG carries a credit comment, and the site footer credits
  Vectorize (`copyright` in `mkdocs.yml`).

Credit to Vectorize for the engine does not imply endorsement. No Hindsight
figures, names or branding are vendored or used.

## What is vendored

Included, relative to `hindsight-interfig/`:

- `README.md`, `package.json`;
- `src/index.tsx`, `src/model.ts`, `src/geometry.ts`, `src/svg.ts`,
  `src/node-figures.ts`, and the four `src/*.test.ts` files;
- `scripts/figure-svg.mjs`, `scripts/figure-loader.mjs`.

Excluded:

- `demo/` and `index.html`: the Vite gallery;
- `figures/`: Hindsight product content;
- `scripts/export.mjs`: clip export through Playwright and ffmpeg;
- `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`: upstream
  tooling.

## Local adaptations

Files under `upstream/` are never edited. Praetor's adaptations live outside it:

- `role="img"`, `<title>`, `<desc>` and a credit comment injected into each
  exported SVG: `tools/figures/core.mjs`.
- A static SVG variant (`steps: []`) for reduced motion:
  `tools/figures/core.mjs`.
- Arrow, Home and End keys across the scenario tabs, and a tab-list label:
  `tools/figures/keyboard.ts`.
- Theme colours mapped to Material for MkDocs variables, and a focus outline:
  `tools/figures/figures.css`.

Each adaptation is offered upstream (ADR-0015, section 6). A later sync that
brings in the upstream fix retires the local shim.

## Tests

```bash
node --test 'tools/figures/third_party/interfig/upstream/src/*.test.ts'
```

All 13 upstream tests pass at the pin. On Node 26 the run prints
`[DEP0205] DeprecationWarning: module.register() is deprecated`. The warning
comes from upstream's `scripts/figure-svg.mjs`, which `src/figure-svg.test.ts`
starts as a child process. Praetor's build never calls that script:
`tools/figures/core.mjs` imports `toSvg` from `src/svg.ts` directly.

## Updating the pin

`scripts/sync_interfig.py` owns the pin (ADR-0015, section 8):

- `python3 scripts/sync_interfig.py verify` runs offline, in
  `make interfig-verify`. It checks that `upstream/` matches the `vendor.json`
  hashes, that the include list covers every file, that the LICENSE hash is the
  reviewed `license_sha256`, and that the `REUSE.toml` MIT override is the last
  annotation covering each vendored file.
- `python3 scripts/sync_interfig.py check` compares the newest upstream commit
  under `hindsight-interfig/` with `path_commit`. It exits 3 on drift, with the
  compare URL and the update command, and 1 on any other failure.
- `python3 scripts/sync_interfig.py update --commit <sha>` vendors `<sha>`, a
  full 40-character commit sha, runs the upstream tests and the figure build,
  and rebuilds the committed player.

The weekly `interfig-sync.yml` workflow runs `check` and fails with the update
command when upstream has moved. To update the pin:

1. Run the printed command. It works from any directory and needs `node` and
   `npm` on `PATH`:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/sync_interfig.py update --commit <sha>
   ```

   It stops before touching the tree if the repository-root `LICENSE` changed,
   if `src/` or `scripts/` (subdirectories included) holds a file that is
   neither included nor excluded, or if the upstream `react` peer range does
   not admit the `react` version in `tools/figures/package.json`. Otherwise it
   swaps in the new `upstream/` and `vendor.json` together, restoring the
   previous tree if the swap fails, then runs the upstream tests,
   `npm --prefix tools/figures run build`, the locked
   `npm ci --prefix tools/figures --ignore-scripts` and
   `npm --prefix tools/figures run bundle`, which rewrites the committed player
   in `tools/figures/dist/`. If any of them fails, revert the update.
   `git clean` removes the new upstream files and figure outputs that
   `git checkout` leaves behind:

   ```bash
   git checkout -- tools/figures/third_party/interfig docs/assets/figures tools/figures/dist
   git clean -fd -- tools/figures/third_party/interfig/upstream docs/assets/figures
   ```

2. Add a new upstream file to the include or exclude list in `vendor.json`
   first, when step 1 stops on one.
3. Commit the rewritten `upstream/`, `vendor.json`, the regenerated
   `docs/assets/figures/` and the rebuilt `tools/figures/dist/`. The command
   prints the upstream commits under `hindsight-interfig/` since the old pin and
   the compare URL for the pull-request body. The list is best effort: when
   GitHub rate-limits or fails the request, the update still succeeds and
   prints only the compare URL.
